## Description

The SWAPI Explorer came about when creating a project for the students at The Iron Yard. The purpose was to implement React and Redux in order to create a simple, but yet powerful, UI for the swapi database. The app helps users explore each endpoint of the database while creating associations between endpoints. I also implemented a filter in order to sort out endpoints based on similar attributes.

I also implemented a second API in order to retrieve movie posters when viewing the 'details' page for the movies.

## Todo

I'm in the process of adding a user auth interface, as well as adding the following pages: planets, vehicles, species.

## Techs

React
Redux
Bootstrap 4 (beta)
Reactstrap

## Swapi?

The Star Wars API is the world's first quantified and programmatically-formatted set of Star Wars data.

After hours of watching films and trawling through content online, we present to you all the People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from Star Wars.

We've formatted this data in JSON and exposed it to you in a RESTish implementation that allows you to programmatically collect and measure the data.

Check out the documentation to get started consuming swapi data.
